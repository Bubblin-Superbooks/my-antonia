When a farmer once got into the habit of going to Cutter, it was like gambling or the lottery; in an hour of discouragement he went back.</p><p>Cutter’s first name was Wycliffe, and he liked to talk about his pious bringing-up. He contributed regularly to the Protestant churches, ‘for sentiment’s sake,’ as he said with a flourish of the hand. He came from a town in Iowa where there were a great many Swedes, and could speak a little Swedish, which gave him a great advantage with the early Scandinavian settlers.</p></div> </div>
