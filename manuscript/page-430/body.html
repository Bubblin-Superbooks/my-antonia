An awkward little Russian girl whom she had taken into her work-room had dropped a flat-iron on Lena’s toe. On the table beside her there was a basket of early summer flowers which the Pole had left after he heard of the accident. He always managed to know what went on in Lena’s apartment.</p><p>Lena was telling me some amusing piece of gossip about one of her clients, when I interrupted her and picked up the flower basket.</p><p>‘This old chap will be proposing to you some day, Lena.’</p><p>‘Oh, he has—often!’ she murmured.</p><p>‘What! After you’ve refused him?’</p><p>‘He doesn’t mind that. It seems to cheer him to mention the subject. Old men are like that, you know. It makes them feel important to think they’re in love with somebody.’</p></div> </div>
