Grandmother wants to know if you can’t go to the term of school that begins next week over at the sod schoolhouse. She says there’s a good teacher, and you’d learn a lot.’</p><p>Antonia stood up, lifting and dropping her shoulders as if they were stiff. ‘I ain’t got time to learn. I can work like mans now.

She turned her face from me and looked off at the red streak of dying light, over the dark prairie.</p></div> </div>
