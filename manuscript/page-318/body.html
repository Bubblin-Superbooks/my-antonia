<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In every frontier settlement there are men who have come there to escape restraint. Cutter was one of the ‘fast set’ of Black Hawk business men. He was an inveterate gambler, though a poor loser. When we saw a light burning in his office late at night, we knew that a game of poker was going on. Cutter boasted that he never drank anything stronger than sherry, and he said he got his start in life by saving the money that other young men spent for cigars. He was full of moral maxims for boys. When he came to our house on business, he quoted ‘Poor Richard’s Almanack’ to me, and told me he was delighted to find a town boy who could milk a cow. He was particularly affable to grandmother, and whenever they met he would begin at once to talk about ‘the good old times’ and simple living. I detested his pink, bald head, and his yellow whiskers, always soft and glistening. It was said he brushed them every night, as a woman does her hair.</p></div> </div>
